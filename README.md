# 🤖 Machine Learning Tutorials 📚

This repository contains a series of comprehensive machine learning tutorials implemented in Google Colab. These tutorials cover a wide range of topics in machine learning, from basic data preprocessing to advanced deep learning techniques.

## 📋 Contents

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Introduction to data retrieval, inspection, cleaning, and splitting.
2. **Classification**: Implementing and comparing various classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
3. **Regression**: Exploring different regression techniques (Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Ridge) using the California Housing Prices dataset.
4. **Unsupervised Learning**: Applying clustering (K-means, Hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) techniques on the Iris dataset.
5. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Building and training an MLP for image classification using the MNIST dataset.
6. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Implementing a CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
7. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Comparing different RNN architectures (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU) for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.
